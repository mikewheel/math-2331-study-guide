If you're like me, you probably find the text for Northeastern's *Linear Algebra* course to be a little bit long-winded. In an effort to study for the upcoming final, I've distilled the contents of the textbook into the main points that I (and students like me) need to remember in order to solve problems and make the grade.

Use it as a refresher for content covered earlier in the course, or as a handy reference sheet while solving practice problems. If you have any issues (typos, requests for additional content, etc.,) feel free to make an issue, or just shoot me an email at my Husky Email. Note that this is specific to *MATH 2331* at Northeastern University; as a result the PDF contains only the content that is covered in that course.

Enjoy!
