If you're like me, you probably find the text for Northeastern's *Linear Algebra* course to be a little bit long-winded. In an effort to study for the upcoming final, I've distilled the contents of the textbook into the main takeaways â€” no proofs, no examples, no narrative, just good old theorems and concepts.

Use it as a refresher for content covered earlier in the course, or as a handy reference sheet while solving practice problems. If you have any issues (typos, requests for additional content, etc) feel free to [make an issue](https://github.com/mikewheel/math-2331-study-guide/issues), or just shoot me an email at my Husky Email.

Note that this is specific to *MATH 2331* at Northeastern University; as a result the PDF contains only the content that is covered in that course. The study guide is based on content from *Linear Algebra with Applications, 5th Ed* by Otto Brescher.

Enjoy!
